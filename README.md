# Description
Adds a button to your fridges that works like all existing stacks, but is connected with every fridge in the location.

# Installation
* Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
* Unzip this mod into Stardew Valley/Mods.
* Run the game using SMAPI.

# Compatibility
* Works with Stardew Valley 1.4.5 on Windows. Unknown capability for other platforms/mobile. Let me know if there are issues and I'll see what I can do.
* Works in single player. Multiplayer functionality has been added but not tested. The button should be disabled if more than one fridge is in use at a time.
* Not tested for compatibility with other mods that alter the fridge UI. If conflicts exist, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

# Usage
As soon as you own a fridge there will be a new button on the UI to add to all existing stacks within all fridges. Note that if you only have one fridge it will act the same as the add to existing stacks button.

# Uninstalling
Remove the mod from the Stardew Valley/Mods folder.
